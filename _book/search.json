    "text": "1.1 Full and empty world\nThe plastic cover and the net wrapped around Christo’s globe thus represent the interconnectedness and interdependence of the Earth’s various elements, and emphasize the need to maintain and preserve these relationships. A similar idea was described by the economist Herman Daly (2015), who put forth a concept of the “empty” and the “full” world. The empty world describes a situation in which human activities and resource use have only a minor impact on the environment. In this world, natural systems are still intact and untouched, and resources are sufficient to meet human needs. This contrasts with the full world, in which human activities and resource use overload the ecosystem and pollute the environment. Since at least the Second World War, we have pursued an industrialized society and a growth economy. As a result, we now live in a “full” world, where natural resources are scarce and the balance of ecosystems is under threat. Daly’s epiphany came in 1962 upon reading Rachel Carson’s book, Silent Spring, which called for a life in harmony with nature. Daly was already sceptical about the hyper-individualism of economic models, and Carson’s work highlighted the conflict between a growing economy and a fragile environment. Following a lecture by the economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen on his magnum opus, The Entropy Law and the Economic Process (1971), Daly adopted the idea that the economy was more like an hourglass than a pendulum, with valuable resources turning into waste and thus largely irreversibly lost. There is no master plan to counter the polycrisis and make our economic and social system more sustainable.",

    "text": "1.2 This book\nTo contribute to sustainable development, we need to analyse the causes of symptoms such as biodiversity loss or global warming, and learn to understand how they are connected and how they interact. We will therefore look at current problems and challenges such as global warming, pollution, biodiversity loss, social inequality, and economic disparities, to understand how they can be tackled at both the local and the global level. The aim of this textbook is to encourage readers to think critically about the role of individuals, communities, businesses, and governments in the context of sustainable development – and thus to identify and pursue approaches to support sustainable development. In addition, we want to develop visions of the future, especially in the Master’s study programmes, that make it possible to imagine a high quality of life in a sustainable modern age, and that make changing the present seem attractive rather than daunting. We want to envision a different food culture, a different economic system, a different type of land use, and a different way of building and living. To make progress towards sustainability, it will be critical to engage stakeholders and foster collaboration across sectors and disciplines. As this textbook will emphasize, education, communication, and participation will also be indispensable in shaping a more sustainable future. With Christo’s Wrapped Globe in mind, and Daly’s understanding of the empty and the full world as a foundation, we will embark on a journey through the many aspects of sustainable development. We hope that you will find this journey both informative and inspiring, and that it will give you an understanding of both the urgency and the opportunities for sustainable development.\nFinally, we hope that our study programmes will inspire students to reflect on their own roles and responsibilities in relation to sustainability, and that it will equip you to make a difference to ensure that the Earth remains a place worth living in for future generations. Only together can we bring about the changes needed to create a sustainable, just, and environmentally friendly world.\n\n\n\n\nTooze, Adam. 2022. “Welcome to the World of the Polycrisis.” Financial Times, October.",

    "text": "3 A normative concept\nTo achieve sustainability, we need sustainable development: a strategic process that requires changes in our socio-ecological systems and institutions. “Development” implies controlled improvement, and the ethical question of what exactly “better” means is key. The use of the term “development” has been criticized by some (e.g. Lang et al. 2014; Kothari et al. 2019), as it is often equated with unbridled growth. Unbridled growth of the “ecological footprint” – the proportion of the biosphere used for human production, consumption, and waste – is unsustainable in the long term. Nonetheless, there are different interpretations of “development”, ranging from economic growth to improving quality of life. Sustainable development therefore remains a stimulating and controversial concept. Sustainability and sustainable development play a key role in today’s political discourse. The term “unsustainability” refers to conditions or developments that are considered negative, while “sustainability” represents a positive state.\nThe concept of sustainable development commits us to certain values and norms that define ethical goals and rules of behaviour. These values and norms shape our ideas of what we consider a desirable or “positive” change. A neutral point of view is not possible, as our perceptions are shaped by a variety of influences. Our personal experiences, upbringing, social environment, and cultural background all influence how we see and interpret the world, including our perceptions of what “should be” and what actions “should be taken”. Ethics play a key role in determining how the current situation can be improved to achieve sustainability, by defining normative goals and limits. Sustainable development is therefore a conceptual framework that is strongly driven by ethical considerations.\nSustainability challenges such as poverty reduction and climate change are therefore ethical challenges. The identification of situations as sustainability problems (and therefore as “negative”) and the choice of solutions are based on ethical values. Sustainability goals are also based on ethical values, as well as on knowledge of cause-and-effect relationships. Sustainability issues are often referred to as “wicked problems”, because of their complex and pluralistic nature. Global warming, in particular, has been described as a “super wicked problem”, as finding solutions is urgent, political institutions are often inadequate, and decision-making processes suffer from short-sightedness.",

    "section": "3.1 Global challenges as wicked problems",
    "text": "3.1 Global challenges as wicked problems\nMike Hulme, author of Why We Disagree About Climate Change (2009), suggests that we view climate change as a “wicked problem” of enormous scale and likely longevity. This approach helps us see climate change not as a problem that needs to be solved, but as a condition in which we are directly involved. The categorization of problems as “wicked”, i.e. those that do not lend themselves to clear-cut solutions, originated with the planning theorists Horst Rittl and Melvin Webber (1973). They argued that planners have to deal with unpredictable human behaviour, and that some problems are too complicated to be solved completely. Some “wicked problems” may never be fully solved, but we can learn to cope with them and not let them dominate us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWicked problems\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Bannink and Trommel (2019), wicked problems arise at the intersection of factual uncertainty and a heterogeneity of preferences and interests. Wicked problems are characterized by (Rittel & Weber, 1973; Alford, 2017; Sediri, 2020):\n\nComplexity: Wicked problems are characterized by many interrelated factors and interactions. There are no clear cause-and-effect relationships, and changes in one area can have unforeseen effects in other areas.\nNormative conflicts: Wicked problems are perceived and interpreted differently by different stakeholders and interest groups. There is no clear definition or consensus on what exactly the problem is, or how it should be solved.\nInterdisciplinarity: Wicked problems require an interdisciplinary approach as they involve different topics, perspectives, and stakeholders. Finding a solution often requires the cooperation and coordination of different disciplines and experts. Uncertainty: Incorrect, missing, or inaccessible information about the problem situation and about the continuity of the values of the variables involved.\nNo definitive solution: Wicked problems defy clear-cut solutions. They are dynamic, change over time, and require continuous adjustment and iterations. Examples of wicked problems include climate change, poverty alleviation, global health, and sustainability. The complexity and interaction of different factors in these areas make it difficult to find simple and clear-cut solutions. Dealing with wicked problems requires a high degree of reflection, collaboration, and the use of systemic thinking methods.\n\n\n\n\nHow have we manoeuvred ourselves into the current situation, where wicked problems pose such a challenge to sustainable development? In this textbook, we will analyse and learn to understand three key global challenges:\n\nthe emergence of human-induced global warming;\nthe persistence of global poverty and rising inequalities;\nand the threat of species extinction and overexploitation of natural resources.\n\nThe debate about human influence on global warming and climate change has intensified since the publications of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The driving force behind global warming is our dependence on oil and other fossil fuels for transport, (electricity) generation, agriculture, and many everyday products. Another wicked problem is global poverty. Although there have been global efforts to reduce poverty for decades, the globalized market economy often leads to increased poverty in certain regions, and the gap between rich and poor seems to be widening overall (Chancel et al., 2021). High-income countries have maintained their prosperity and living standards at the expense of others. These are “externalized costs”, and they include environmental degradation. For example, the wealth and living standards of high-income countries are largely responsible for the threat of species extinction and the overuse of natural resources (Lessenich, 2018). In addition to the abovementioned “big three” – climate change, poverty, and biodiversity loss – there are many other global sustainability challenges, such as deforestation, desertification, declining soil fertility, dwindling fish stocks, pollution, wars, conflicts, and increasing migration. In analysing these comprehensive challenges we must also consider the temporal dimension. In 2004, graphs depicting socio-economic and Earth system trends from 1750 to 2000 were first published, revealing a dramatic upsurge and aptly termed “The Great Acceleration” (Steffen et al., 2004).\nThe Great Acceleration described the exponential growth dynamics that occurred after the Industrial Revolution, which led to a surge in productivity in the mode of production and a significant increase in material wealth. At the same time, but to a much lesser extent, there was a massive increase in natural resource consumption and emissions. Socio-economic growth went hand in hand with the acceleration of biophysical trends. Figures 6 and 7 describe some examples of important biophysical and socio-economic indicators, all of which start to increase with the Industrial Revolution. From the middle of the 20th century, the trend towards exponential growth becomes apparent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn illustration of exponential growth\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wheat and Chessboard Problem is a mathematical problem often used to illustrate the concept of exponential growth. In the story, a servant asks the king to fill every square on a chessboard with grains of wheat, doubling the number on each square. Growth starts slowly, but with each doubling, the number of grains increases exponentially. By the 50th square, the number of rice grains would be large enough to cover Berlin’s 365-metre-high television tower on Alexanderplatz. This story illustrates the immense power of exponential growth and its impressive results. Understanding the concept of exponential growth is crucial to analysing phenomena such as population growth, technological progress, environmental change, and the spread of disease. It illustrates how even small changes or developments in a system can have a significant impact. History reminds us that we need to think carefully about how we manage such growth and the long-term consequences it can have.\n\n\n\nResource extraction has increased significantly in recent decades, from 22 billion tonnes in 1970 to 70 billion tonnes in 2010 (UNEP, 2016). Global warming is another pressing issue. The latest IPCC report (IPCC, 2023) predicts an increase in global average temperature of between 1.5 and 5.8 degrees Celsius, depending on the scenario and future emissions. Another alarming phenomenon is deforestation. Every two seconds, an area of forest the size of a football field is cut down – an area the size of New York City every day. And then there is the decline in biodiversity, marked by the extinction of animal and plant species, which threatens the ecological diversity of our planet. The Great Acceleration (Figures 6 and 7) describes the observable and measurable (negative) developments of key socio-economic and biophysical indicators since 1950. The causes of these negative developments can be far removed from the place where the problems arise or become most evident. For example, job losses in one country may be caused by a multinational company’s decision to relocate part of its operations to another country, in order to maximize profits. We cannot hope to fix such issues unless we understand how the system – in this case, the globalized economy – works. Similarly, we need to understand the Earth’s global climate systems to imagine what the consequences of global warming might be in a particular area or region. This is why many of the methods and concepts of sustainability science require systemic thinking. A systemic thinking approach often begins with brainstorming to create a “rich picture” of all the factors you need to consider in order to understand the current behaviour of the system in question. For example, in the case of a multinational company closing a particular business unit, these would be the factors that might influence the decision to continue, expand, or close certain business units. While an initial mapping might look overly complex or even messy, creating a linear flowchart can help clarify the flows of inputs and influences. This kind of mapping may already reveal opportunities to reassess the relevant influences and redesign the system to avoid unwanted outcomes. However, further work may be required to develop “conceptual models” of the system that identify unforeseen opportunities for improvement. Incorporating systemic thinking into the methods and concepts of sustainability science enables us to tackle the complexity of problems and develop sound strategies for sustainable development. Systemic thinking thus provides an important basis for understanding and shaping the different understandings and concepts of sustainable development, as the next chapter discusses in more detail.",

    "text": "4 Debates about planetary boundaries\nIn 1798, British economist Thomas Robert Malthus published his influential essay, An Essay on the Principle of Population. Malthus’s core idea was that population growth would surpass Earth’s ability to produce food, sparking a debate on planetary carrying capacity that continues today. The Limits to Growth (1972), a report by the Club of Rome, built on Malthus’s ideas. It went beyond just food supply to consider a broader range of factors in calculating a planetary limit. These factors included resource availability, environmental pollution, and industrial output. The report remains relevant from an environmental point of view, as it challenges the assumptions of limitless growth, even though its specific predictions haven’t quite come true.\nA significant development in sustainability science is the planetary boundaries concept, introduced in 2009. Unlike earlier theories focused solely on population limits, this framework uses Earth system science parameters. Researchers identified the Holocene epoch as a baseline, as this was a period of remarkable stability for human development. Significant deviations from this ideal state could push humanity towards uncertain “tipping points” – critical thresholds that can either interrupt previous progress, alter its course, or even accelerate it in unintended ways. An example might be the extinction of megafauna at the end of the last ice age, potentially linked to human arrival in the Americas. The planetary boundaries concept promotes the precautionary principle, urging action to minimize potential harm to both humans and the environment.\nThe concept, which puts forward nine planetary boundaries, was first introduced by Johan Rockström et al. (2009). It was updated by Will Steffen et al. (2015). A recent update by Richardson et al. (2023) shows that six out of nine planetary boundaries have already been transgressed.\nThe planetary boundaries framework identifies nine critical Earth system processes. These processes regulate the planet’s stability and include, for example, land system change and ocean acidification (see all planetary boundaries here: Figure 1) . Each boundary has an inner circle, within which it can operate safely (“safe operating space”) and an outer circle, which represents increased uncertainty.\nThe latest update to the planetary boundaries framework paints a concerning picture. We’re close to overstepping the safe operating space for ocean acidification, and regional atmospheric aerosol loading has already crossed its boundary. In a positive development, stratospheric ozone levels show some signs of recovery. However, the overall situation is alarming. The boundaries previously identified as transgressed (climate change, biosphere integrity (genetic diversity), land system change, and biogeochemical flows [N and P]) have all seen a worsening of their transgression since 2015.\nThe study added human appropriation of net primary production as a control variable for the functional component of biosphere integrity, arguing that this boundary has also been exceeded. In addition, the significant transgression of the planetary boundaries for phosphorus and nitrogen cycles, along with genetic biodiversity, raise the risk of fatal consequences.\nTwo of the nine planetary boundaries – biosphere integrity and climate change – are considered “core boundaries”. These core systems encompass processes from many other subsystems and operate at a global scale. Reaching tipping points in these core systems could therefore push the entire Earth system into a new state.",

These tipping points can destabilize the climate and lead to accelerated climate change. Examples of tipping points include the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, the collapse of the Amazon rainforest, the thawing of permafrost soils, and changes in the Gulf Stream. If these tipping points are reached or exceeded, they can trigger self-reinforcing feedback effects that lead to further warming and an intensification of climate change.\nThe concept of tipping points emphasizes the urgency of limiting global warming and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. If we exceed the tipping points, it will become increasingly difficult to control climate change and minimize its effects.",

    "section": "4.2 Quantifying planetary boundaries",
    "text": "4.2 Quantifying planetary boundaries\nA recent development within the planetary boundaries framework is the concept of “safe and just Earth system boundaries (ESBs)” for the following domains: climate, the biosphere, water and nutrient cycles, and aerosols at global and subglobal scales (Rockström et al., 2023). The ESBs are based on modelling and literature review, and account for uncertainty through different levels of likelihood. Staying within the ESBs protects stability and equity between species and future generations, although current generations, especially vulnerable groups, could still suffer harm. The authors therefore suggest stricter boundaries in some cases, and the addition of local standards to protect current generations and ecosystems. For example, they identify safe ESBs for warming (see Rockström et al. 2023, Fig. 1 and Table 1). These are based on reducing the probability of triggering climate tipping points, maintaining biosphere and cryosphere functions, and considering climate variability of the Holocene (&lt;0.5-1.0°C) and earlier interglacial periods (&lt;1.5-2°C).\nThe functions of the cryosphere include the preservation of permafrost in the northern high latitudes, the preservation of polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers, and the minimization of sea ice loss. The authors conclude that global warming of more than 1.0°C above pre-industrial levels, which has already been exceeded (IPPC 2021), could trigger tipping effects such as the collapse of the Greenland ice sheet or a localized abrupt thawing of the boreal permafrost with a moderate probability (Armstrong et al. 2022). Global warming of one degree Celsius corresponds to the safe limit proposed in 1990 and the PB of 350 ppm CO2 (Steffen et al. 2015). With a warming of more than 1.5°C or 2.0°C, the likelihood of triggering tipping points increases to high or very high.",

    "text": "4.3 Climate resilience\nResilience describes the ability of a system to withstand disruptions, “bounce back”, or recover from adversity. Originally used in psychology, resilience refers to the psychological robustness that an individual has actively acquired in dealing with challenges or stresses, particularly in childhood. In the context of ecosystems, resilience refers to the ability to absorb disturbances without a permanent systemic collapse, i.e. a collapse that would result in a different system regulated by new processes (Folke et al. 2010). More recently, the concept of resilience has been extended to social systems (see section on doughnut economics). Studies focus on which specific characteristics of a region need to be strengthened, to better prepare it for future crises and disasters related to climate change, terrorism, resource scarcity, or financial crises. The climate crisis, for example, requires both adaptation and mitigation measures. Resilience approaches offer a way of combining these two concepts rather than playing them off against each other.\nClimate mitigation measures aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb climate change. Such measures include promoting renewable energies, improving energy efficiency, and expanding public transport. Resilience approaches emphasize the importance of climate mitigation, as limiting the rise in temperature will help to reduce the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events.\nClimate adaptation measures aim to make societies and ecosystems more resilient to the current and expected effects of climate change. Adaptation measures include the development of early warning systems for extreme weather events, coastal protection against rising sea levels, the reduction of heat stress (e.g. through more urban green spaces), runoff or infiltration areas to reduce the damaging effects of heavy rainfall events, or the adaptation of agricultural practices to changing climatic conditions. Resilience approaches emphasize the need for climate adaptation to protect communities and ecosystems from the negative effects of climate change.",

Despite this criticism, the planetary boundaries framework makes a valuable contribution to the debate on sustainable development and raises awareness of the limited resources and resilience of our planet.

    "text": "5.1 Flagship WBGU report\nA flagship report by the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU), World in Transition, is an important publication that addresses the challenges and opportunities of a sustainable transformation of society. It was first published in 1994 and has since been updated several times. The report analyses global environmental changes, including climate change, biodiversity loss, and resource consumption, and proposes concrete policies and social change to promote sustainable development.\nWorld in Transition is significant to debates on the great transformation, as it argues for a far-reaching transformation of business, policy, and society. This vision extends beyond mere adaptation, demanding fundamental shifts in the structures and patterns of economic activity and daily life. The report underscores the urgency of driving forward the transition to a climate-friendly and environmentally sound economy and way of living. It emphasizes the critical role of a comprehensive sustainability policy. Finally, it identifies innovation, technology, education, institutional reforms, and international cooperation as key levers for achieving sustainable development.\nIn Chapter 8, World in Transition distinguishes between two concepts: “transformation research and education” and “transformative research and education”. These concepts are key to promoting fundamental change towards sustainability.\nTransformation research analyses processes of change, particularly in the context of sustainable development. It seeks to understand the dynamics and complexity of transformations, and to identify possible courses of action for a sustainable future. Transformation research offers an inter- and transdisciplinary perspective, and it involves different actors and stakeholders in the research process.\nTransformation education is education that aims to impart the knowledge, skills, and values needed to achieve a sustainable transformation of society. It includes formal and informal educational measures that enable people to actively participate in transformation processes and to promote sustainable thinking and action.\nTransformative research not only generates knowledge but also goes a step further, by actively striving for change towards sustainability. It thus aims to influence social practice and develop solutions and innovations for sustainable development. Transformative research works closely with partners from practice, and strives to translate knowledge into action.\nTransformative education fosters a shift in mindsets, values, and behaviour towards sustainability. It goes beyond imparting knowledge, by also promoting critical awareness, empathy, and action for sustainable changes in society.\nThe WBGU believes that the state should take on tasks that are not adequately performed by individuals or the private sector. It recognizes that the state plays a decisive role in creating framework conditions and shaping political measures to promote sustainable development. The state can drive innovative solutions, steer investments, establish regulations, and implement policies that enable a sustainable transformation.\nHowever, the WBGU also emphasizes that effective government intervention should take place in collaboration with other actors and stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector, and academia. Jointly shaping a sustainable future is about creating partnerships and involving different expertise.",

    "text": "5.2 Schneidewind’s “art of the future”\nThe German economist and politician, Uwe Schneidewind, discusses the concept of the great transformation in his 2018 book, Die grosse Transformation: Eine Einführung in die Kunst des gesellschaftlichen Wandels, which translates as The Great Transformation: An Introduction to the Art of Social Change. Schneidewind points out that a great transformation isn’t dictated by the unstoppable development dynamics of modern societies or by a technocratic blueprint for an ecologically just society. Instead, he sees it as a process that should be actively shaped by many actors. As such, it’s important to have a clearly defined normative compass and to develop the ability to navigate complex social, cultural, economic, and technological processes. He describes this ability as the “art of the future” – the skill of making desirable futures possible – and thus builds a bridge to Harald Welzer’s FUTURZWEI. Welzer, a psychologist and sociologist, emphasizes the importance of imagination, creativity, and engagement in bringing about transformative change and developing alternative visions of the future.",

Intended for publication every four years, the aim of the GSDR is to synthesize existing knowledge and identify pathways to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The latest report (2023) highlights the significant gap between current progress and achieving the SDGs. Building on the 2019 report, it introduces capacity building as a new lever to accelerate progress.\nThe GSDR proposes six key areas, or “entry points”, with the highest potential to drive the large-scale and swift transformations needed. To initiate these transformations, active and multifaceted collaboration is crucial among actors from diverse fields: governance, business and finance, individual and collective action, and science and technology.",

    "text": "6.1 Criticism and conclusion\nThe core thesis of the green economy is that environmental and economic goals are not contradictory. Instead, they can be reconciled through appropriate economic incentives and strategies. The green economy aims to foster both economic growth and environmental sustainability through public and private investment in low-emission, resource-efficient, and socially equitable economic systems.\nCritics, however, have raised concerns about the effectiveness of green economy measures. They argue that the proposed technologies and incentives are insufficient to bring about the far-reaching systemic changes needed. An overemphasis on economic growth and technological solutions could potentially neglect essential structural and behavioural changes. And they warn that the global transition to a green economy could leave behind disadvantaged communities and developing countries, if their specific needs are not addressed.",
