<p>Where do the concept, mission statement, and guiding principles of sustainable development come from? How did the concept emerge, how did it evolve – and why? The following explanations provide an overview of the history of sustainability, the political background, and key conferences and documents. In short, what has made sustainability what it is today. It’s about seeing the big picture. Because only those who know the past can assess the future.</p>
<p>Sustainability has been the buzzword of recent years, from science to politics and business to the media. Initially, the term has a positive connotation because it is associated with the long term, the durable, and many things are sustainable today: coffee, corporate philosophy, even tuna pizzas. These are the demands of a consumer society with an inconsiderate appetite for abundance. First thing in the morning, the shampoo removes our dandruff “sustainably”. Then we drive to work at a company that prides itself on its “sustainable corporate philosophy”, and over lunch we discuss sustainable investments. At home, we stick a tuna pizza in the oven – sustainably sourced and produced, of course, as it says on the box.</p>
<p>Today, the term “sustainability” is everywhere: it’s used in connection with energy, mobility, building renovation, nutrition, population development, corporate environmental management, and climate protection. It’s also used in art, culture, design, and advertising.</p>

<p>Is the term “sustainability” so overused as to slowly become meaningless? Even if this is the case, we shouldn’t abandon key terms like this lightly. For example, it’s still important for companies to have a sustainability strategy, even if many such strategies are inadequate or amount to greenwashing. We need to clarify the meaning of “sustainability” and hold those who use it to account. And we should base our interpretation on science and historical developments. The historical precursors to the sustainability model explained in this textbook are:</p>

The following explanations provide an overview of the history of sustainability, the political background, and key conferences and documents. In short, what has made sustainability what it is today.

<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-normative-concept"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> A normative concept</h2>
<p>To achieve sustainability, we need sustainable development: a strategic process that requires changes in our socio-ecological systems and institutions. “Development” implies controlled improvement, and the ethical question of what exactly “better” means is key. The use of the term “development” has been criticized by some (e.g.&nbsp;Lang et al.&nbsp;2014; Kothari et al.&nbsp;2019), as it is often equated with unbridled growth. Unbridled growth of the “ecological footprint” – the proportion of the biosphere used for human production, consumption, and waste – is unsustainable in the long term. Nonetheless, there are different interpretations of “development”, ranging from economic growth to improving quality of life. Sustainable development therefore remains a stimulating and controversial concept. Sustainability and sustainable development play a key role in today’s political discourse. The term “unsustainability” refers to conditions or developments that are considered negative, while “sustainability” represents a positive state.</p>
<p>The concept of sustainable development commits us to certain values and norms that define ethical goals and rules of behaviour. These values and norms shape our ideas of what we consider a desirable or “positive” change. A neutral point of view is not possible, as our perceptions are shaped by a variety of influences. Our personal experiences, upbringing, social environment, and cultural background all influence how we see and interpret the world, including our perceptions of what “should be” and what actions “should be taken”. Ethics play a key role in determining how the current situation can be improved to achieve sustainability, by defining normative goals and limits. Sustainable development is therefore a conceptual framework that is strongly driven by ethical considerations.</p>
<p>Sustainability challenges such as poverty reduction and climate change are therefore ethical challenges. The identification of situations as sustainability problems (and therefore as “negative”) and the choice of solutions are based on ethical values. Sustainability goals are also based on ethical values, as well as on knowledge of cause-and-effect relationships. Sustainability issues are often referred to as “wicked problems”, because of their complex and pluralistic nature. Global warming, in particular, has been described as a “super wicked problem”, as finding solutions is urgent, political institutions are often inadequate, and decision-making processes suffer from short-sightedness.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="global-challenges-as-wicked-problems"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Global challenges as wicked problems</h2>
<p>Mike Hulme, author of Why We Disagree About Climate Change (2009), suggests that we view climate change as a “wicked problem” of enormous scale and likely longevity. This approach helps us see climate change not as a problem that needs to be solved, but as a condition in which we are directly involved. The categorization of problems as “wicked”, i.e.&nbsp;those that do not lend themselves to clear-cut solutions, originated with the planning theorists Horst Rittl and Melvin Webber (1973). They argued that planners have to deal with unpredictable human behaviour, and that some problems are too complicated to be solved completely. Some “wicked problems” may never be fully solved, but we can learn to cope with them and not let them dominate us.</p>

<p>According to Bannink and Trommel (2019), wicked problems arise at the intersection of factual uncertainty and a heterogeneity of preferences and interests. Wicked problems are characterized by (Rittel &amp; Weber, 1973; Alford, 2017; Sediri, 2020):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Complexity: Wicked problems are characterized by many interrelated factors and interactions. There are no clear cause-and-effect relationships, and changes in one area can have unforeseen effects in other areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Normative conflicts: Wicked problems are perceived and interpreted differently by different stakeholders and interest groups. There is no clear definition or consensus on what exactly the problem is, or how it should be solved.</p></li>
<li><p>Interdisciplinarity: Wicked problems require an interdisciplinary approach as they involve different topics, perspectives, and stakeholders. Finding a solution often requires the cooperation and coordination of different disciplines and experts. Uncertainty: Incorrect, missing, or inaccessible information about the problem situation and about the continuity of the values of the variables involved.</p></li>
<li><p>No definitive solution: Wicked problems defy clear-cut solutions. They are dynamic, change over time, and require continuous adjustment and iterations. Examples of wicked problems include climate change, poverty alleviation, global health, and sustainability. The complexity and interaction of different factors in these areas make it difficult to find simple and clear-cut solutions. Dealing with wicked problems requires a high degree of reflection, collaboration, and the use of systemic thinking methods.</p></li>

<p>How have we manoeuvred ourselves into the current situation, where wicked problems pose such a challenge to sustainable development? In this textbook, we will analyse and learn to understand three key global challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the emergence of human-induced global warming;</p></li>
<li><p>the persistence of global poverty and rising inequalities;</p></li>
<li><p>and the threat of species extinction and overexploitation of natural resources.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The debate about human influence on global warming and climate change has intensified since the publications of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The driving force behind global warming is our dependence on oil and other fossil fuels for transport, (electricity) generation, agriculture, and many everyday products. Another wicked problem is global poverty. Although there have been global efforts to reduce poverty for decades, the globalized market economy often leads to increased poverty in certain regions, and the gap between rich and poor seems to be widening overall (Chancel et al., 2021). High-income countries have maintained their prosperity and living standards at the expense of others. These are “externalized costs”, and they include environmental degradation. For example, the wealth and living standards of high-income countries are largely responsible for the threat of species extinction and the overuse of natural resources (Lessenich, 2018). In addition to the above mentioned “big three” – climate change, poverty, and biodiversity loss – there are many other global sustainability challenges, such as deforestation, desertification, declining soil fertility, dwindling fish stocks, pollution, wars, conflicts, and increasing migration. In analysing these comprehensive challenges we must also consider the temporal dimension. In 2004, graphs depicting socio-economic and Earth system trends from 1750 to 2000 were first published, revealing a dramatic upsurge and aptly termed “The Great Acceleration” (Steffen et al., 2004).</p>
<p>The Great Acceleration described the exponential growth dynamics that occurred after the Industrial Revolution, which led to a surge in productivity in the mode of production and a significant increase in material wealth. At the same time, but to a much lesser extent, there was a massive increase in natural resource consumption and emissions. Socio-economic growth went hand in hand with the acceleration of biophysical trends. Figures 6 and 7 describe some examples of important biophysical and socio-economic indicators, all of which start to increase with the Industrial Revolution. From the middle of the 20th century, the trend towards exponential growth becomes apparent.</p>

<p>The Wheat and Chessboard Problem is a mathematical problem often used to illustrate the concept of exponential growth. In the story, a servant asks the king to fill every square on a chessboard with grains of wheat, doubling the number on each square. Growth starts slowly, but with each doubling, the number of grains increases exponentially. By the 50th square, the number of rice grains would be large enough to cover Berlin’s 365-metre-high television tower on Alexanderplatz. This story illustrates the immense power of exponential growth and its impressive results. Understanding the concept of exponential growth is crucial to analysing phenomena such as population growth, technological progress, environmental change, and the spread of disease. It illustrates how even small changes or developments in a system can have a significant impact. History reminds us that we need to think carefully about how we manage such growth and the long-term consequences it can have.</p>

<p>Resource extraction has increased significantly in recent decades, from 22 billion tonnes in 1970 to 70 billion tonnes in 2010 (UNEP, 2016). Global warming is another pressing issue. The latest IPCC report (IPCC, 2023) predicts an increase in global average temperature of between 1.5 and 5.8 degrees Celsius, depending on the scenario and future emissions. Another alarming phenomenon is deforestation. Every two seconds, an area of forest the size of a football field is cut down – an area the size of New York City every day. And then there is the decline in biodiversity, marked by the extinction of animal and plant species, which threatens the ecological diversity of our planet. The Great Acceleration (Figures 6 and 7) describes the observable and measurable (negative) developments of key socio-economic and biophysical indicators since 1950. The causes of these negative developments can be far removed from the place where the problems arise or become most evident. For example, job losses in one country may be caused by a multinational company’s decision to relocate part of its operations to another country, in order to maximize profits. We cannot hope to fix such issues unless we understand how the system – in this case, the globalized economy – works. Similarly, we need to understand the Earth’s global climate systems to imagine what the consequences of global warming might be in a particular area or region. This is why many of the methods and concepts of sustainability science require systemic thinking. A systemic thinking approach often begins with brainstorming to create a “rich picture” of all the factors you need to consider in order to understand the current behaviour of the system in question. For example, in the case of a multinational company closing a particular business unit, these would be the factors that might influence the decision to continue, expand, or close certain business units. While an initial mapping might look overly complex or even messy, creating a linear flowchart can help clarify the flows of inputs and influences. This kind of mapping may already reveal opportunities to reassess the relevant influences and redesign the system to avoid unwanted outcomes. However, further work may be required to develop “conceptual models” of the system that identify unforeseen opportunities for improvement. Incorporating systemic thinking into the methods and concepts of sustainability science enables us to tackle the complexity of problems and develop sound strategies for sustainable development. Systemic thinking thus provides an important basis for understanding and shaping the different understandings and concepts of sustainable development, as the next chapter discusses in more detail.</p>

<p>What does “sustainable” mean? We could argue that sustainability means the existence and functioning – for as long as possible – of structures of various degrees of complexity. There are, in fact, many structures in the world that have existed for relatively long periods of time, such as atoms, certain ecosystems, life on Earth as a whole, or planetary systems and galaxies. But why are some structures relatively stable and able to exist “sustainably”, despite being exposed to regular disturbances that jeopardize their existence or function? Are there principles or mechanisms that could explain the continued existence of these diverse systems? And if so – could human societies learn from these principles?</p>
<p>As early as the mid-20th century, scientists began to recognize that fundamental principles connect all aspects of existence, shaping the universe’s order and dynamics. A key figure in this field was Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy (1901–1972). His research began with his reflections on the “formation of form” in nature (1928), which he further developed in publications on the structure of life (1937), molecules and organisms (1940), and biology (1949). In 1950, he introduced a theory of open systems in physics and biology, a concept that significantly influenced the development of biophysics, fluid equilibrium, and modern developmental theories. His seminal work, “General System Theory”, was published in 1968.</p>
<p>Systems theory laid the foundation for a revolutionary world view that not only provided explanations for the development and function of so-called systems, but also integrated isolated knowledge from various disciplines. In 1975, in a significant contribution to systems theory, Ervin Laszlo distinguished between seven different system types (physico-chemical and biological systems, organ systems, socio-ecological and socio-cultural systems, and organizational and technical systems). Today, systems theory forms the basis for models for the development of complex systems and for cybernetics, which deals with the control of systems. The Club of Rome report used systems theory to analyse the growth of processes in the context of positive feedback.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="systemic-effects-escalation-and-feedback"><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Systemic effects: Escalation and feedback</h3>
<p>In systems theory, the mechanisms of positive and negative feedback are used to explain the dynamics and stability of systems. Positive feedback reinforces changes in a system, while negative feedback tends to balance changes, returning the system to a stable state.</p>
<p>An example of positive feedback in relation to the accelerated melting of Artic Sea ice is what is known as albedo amplification. The Arctic ice reflects much of the solar radiation back into space, resulting in less absorption of heat by the ocean. However, when the ice melts, less sunlight is reflected, as the seawater, which is darker, absorbs more heat. This warms the seawater further and the remaining ice melts more rapidly. This process is self-reinforcing, as less ice leads to a lower albedo, which in turn leads to greater absorption of sunlight and further melting. This positive feedback has serious consequences on the climate system, as the dwindling Arctic Sea ice can lead to a faster sea level rise and to changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns. The extent and speed of this occurrence took scientists by surprise (Stroeve et al.&nbsp;2007).</p>
<p>An example of negative feedback is a thermostat that regulates the temperature in a room. If the room temperature rises above the set maximum, the thermostat recognizes this and activates the air conditioning to lower the temperature. As soon as the temperature reaches the set value, the thermostat switches off the air conditioning. This control circuit ensures that the room temperature is maintained at a constant level. Positive and negative feedback often work together and can cause complex behaviour in systems. Understanding these feedback mechanisms makes it possible to better understand and predict the interactions and behaviour of systems.</p>

<p>An emerging awareness – influenced not least by the publication, The Limits to Growth (Meadows et al.&nbsp;1972) – led to increased research into global environmental problems. Three major international research programmes are particularly noteworthy here: 1) the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) from 1987 to 2015; 2) the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), founded in 1980; and 3) the International Research Programme on Biodiversity (DIVERSITAS), founded in 1991 and renamed in 2014 to Future Earth. Not only did these programmes initiate important basic research – they also provided an important impetus for greater consideration of the results in policy, as reflected, for example, in the UN’s Brundtland Report and Agenda 21. Notably, these research programmes systematically brought together previously separate disciplines of the natural sciences for the first time, although they still largely neglected the interaction between society and the environment. As the interconnectedness of these topics began to gain traction, several research projects promoting their integration were launched, particularly in the US.</p>

<p>“A new field of sustainability science is emerging that seeks to understand the fundamental character of interactions between nature and society. Such an understanding must encompass the interaction of global processes with the ecological and social characteristics of particular places and sectors.” Kates et al.&nbsp;2001</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept of sustainability science was officially introduced in 2001 at the “Challenges of a Changing Earth” congress in Amsterdam, by the International Council for Science (ICSU), the above-mentioned IGBP, the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP), and the above-mentioned WCRP. The German-language term “Nachhaltigkeitswissenschaft” (sustainability science) can be traced back to a translation from English.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="understanding-sustainability-science"><span class="header-section-number">1.5.1</span> Understanding sustainability science</h3>
<p>An often used motto – “society has problems – universities have disciplines” – epitomizes the conventional structure of science into various disciplines. However, disciplinary science appears to be inadequately equipped to meet the challenges of sustainable development. Two main approaches to understanding sustainability science have emerged: on the one hand, it is seen as an independent discipline with its own theories and methods; on the other, as an amalgamation of different disciplines focusing on a common theme (Clark and Dickson 2003). While the first approach is not yet considered accurate, there is broad agreement that sustainability science should be seen as a platform that brings together science, practice, and visions – and incorporates contributions from the entire spectrum of natural, economic, and social sciences (Martens 2006, p.&nbsp;38).</p>
<p>Sustainability science is distinct in two key ways. First, unlike traditional (“Mode 1”) research, it isn’t driven by an original scientific programme. Instead, it is guided by the normative concept of sustainability, using this as a framework for scientific analysis. Second, as a distinct type of problem-oriented research, it differs from both basic and applied research. Clark (2007) introduced the term “use-inspired basic research”, which seeks to strike a balance by seeking new knowledge while also considering its potential applications.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.5.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="empirica-analytical-vs-normative"><span class="header-section-number">1.5.2</span> Empirica-analytical vs normative</h3>
<p>As sustainable development is a normative model, it is important to distinguish between descriptive (empirical-analytical) research and prescriptive (normative) research. Descriptive statements describe the current state (“is”), while normative statements describe the ideal state (“ought”). In everyday life, the distinction between “is” and “ought” is often not recognized, but it is crucial for science.</p>
<p>It is important to note that “is” and “ought” statements have different qualities and focus areas, and they cannot simply be linked without further explanation. This understanding forms the basis of Hume’s law, which declares that normative statements about “what ought to be” cannot be derived from descriptive statements about “what is”. To give an extreme example: The fact that around 24,000 people starve to death every day does not allow any conclusions to be drawn as to whether this is good or bad. Without an evaluation, no normative statement can be made about whether this should be prevented. Hume pointed out that many scientists of his time often neglected this crucial distinction, and this is still the case today:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remark’d, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary ways of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surpriz’d to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is however, of the last consequence. For as this ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, ’tis necessary that it shou’d be observ’d and explain’d; and at the same time that a reason should be given; for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it… [I] am persuaded, that a small attention wou’d subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceiv’d by reason.” Hume, David: “A Treatise of Human Nature”, Book 3, Part 1, Section 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The realization that is and ought statements differ does not mean that scientists cannot make ought statements. Rather, it means that due to the epistemological differences between the two categories, certain rules must apply when they are linked. Hume tried to establish the relationship between these two statement types through so-called “bridge principles”. Max Weber further formalized these considerations by replacing the bridge principles with the concept of “value relations”. Weber’s call for value freedom (or value neutrality) in empirical science stems from his observation that there is a clear distinction between factual questions (“is”) and value questions (“ought”) (Weber 1999, p.&nbsp;245f, 509f). He argued that it is not the task of the empirical sciences to make value judgements. If scientists fail to make the analytical distinction between their personal values and their research goals, this could jeopardize the ability of science to produce verifiable and meaningful results (Weber 1999, p.&nbsp;150f; Strauss 1953). In turn, this could lead to a blurring of the boundaries between scientific knowledge and knowledge from politics, religion, or everyday discussions. Weber’s call for value freedom in empirical science was often misunderstood (Jonas 1980, p.189f; Weber 1999, p.&nbsp;499f). It does not mean that research should do without values. (Non-scientific) values have a place in empirical research, particularly in the context of sustainable development, in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Values can be an object of inquiry (research object):</strong> Values play a key role in the field of environmental and sustainability psychology, for example. In discussions about lifestyles and subjective well-being, researchers study the personal values and beliefs of individuals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Values influence the choice of research topic:</strong> Values influence the selection of research objects and questions (epistemological interest), and thus the direction of research. This is particularly relevant in application-oriented and transdisciplinary research, where the needs and information of relevant social actors are integrated into the research process, for example through <em>joint problem framing</em> or <em>participatory vision development</em> (Schneider et al., 2019).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Value interpretations should be clearly stated:</strong> Researchers can create value relationships, or make value interpretations (cf.&nbsp;Weber 1999, p.&nbsp;522). A value interpretation, based on the hermeneutic method, concretizes the meaning of overarching value concepts and derives logical values and norms from them. For example, researchers can analyse the SDGs by examining the values underlying sustainable development. Other examples include norms derived from the concept of justice – such as the norm of human responsibility towards our environment, our social environment, and ourselves (see SRU 1994, p.&nbsp;51; Michelsen 2014, p.&nbsp;25; Schneider et al, 2019). It is important to make the original value explicit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Developing the means to achieve a normative goal:</strong> Sustainable development research often relies on value judgements to guide its pursuit of evidence-based solutions. This is comparable to political science, where normative theories aim to construct an optimal – i.e.&nbsp;just – form of government, based on the positive evaluation of what constitutes a just society. Science cannot prove the value of justice, but it can develop strategies and means to achieve this desired goal. This relationship between ends and means represents a logical connection between values and normative statements. The ultimate goal, or end, is determined by extra-scientific values. The researchers have to clearly state this relationship, and formulate their means accordingly. For example, an end–means connection could look like this: “To achieve goal X, Y is the most successful means under conditions b1, b2, and b3”. Sustainable development can be considered as an extra-scientifically given fundamental norm. For example, if research wants to make statements about how sustainable development can be achieved through solar energy, it could proceed as follows: “Switching to solar production could be a promising way of achieving sustainable development. This would organize production and distribution according to the needs of many people, minimize social inequalities, and create conditions for individual well-being.”</p></li>

<h2 data-number="1.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-knowledge-for-sustainability-research"><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Types of knowledge for sustainability research</h2>
<p>Sustainability research focuses on challenges that threaten the long-term safeguarding of social development conditions. In the context of SD as a challenge for society as a whole, the Forum for Climate and Global Change of the Swiss Academy of Sciences has described three different types of knowledge (ProClim 1997): systems, target, and transformation. These three knowledge types take place at three fundamental levels: 1) the analytical level, which aims to generate systems knowledge; 2) the normative level, which develops target and orientation knowledge; and 3) the operational level, which seeks to generate design or transformation knowledge The figure shows the three knowledge types in relation to empirical-analytical and normative research.</p>
<p><strong>Systems knowledge</strong> refers to the understanding of the current state. In relation to sustainable development, research examines relevant structures and processes, describing and explaining their complexity and dynamics. It uses various methods, including qualitative and quantitative approaches, mixed methods, experiments, and systems dynamics approaches. It also uses forecasts, retrospectives, and scenario analyses. Most of the studies that generate systems knowledge fall within the field of empirical research.</p>
<p><strong>Transformation knowledge</strong> is the knowledge of how we can get from the current state (“is”) to the desired state (“ought”). This requires an integration of both systems and target knowledge. In other words, research is looking for demonstrably effective solutions to the problems identified in the context of sustainable development. There are many methods to generate transformation knowledge. Research on transformations, i.e.&nbsp;the change in social organization at various levels, can be empirical as well as normative. Research focusing on past and present transformations is empirical, while research focusing on concrete goals is normative. Accordingly, the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU), distinguishes between “transformation research” and “transformative research”. Another concept that is emphasized in the context of transformations is “transformative education”, which seeks to promote skills for a comprehensive and multi-layered understanding of change (Schneidewind 2013). As such, transformative education aims to strengthen society’s ability to reflect on issues, for example in terms of observation and in actively shaping transformation processes.</p>
<p><strong>Target knowledge</strong> refers to the knowledge of what should be achieved and what should be avoided. Normative research is particularly important in this context. It is about interpreting and concretizing the values of sustainable development and deriving further standards. Research into the definition of threshold values is just as relevant as methods for assessments and visioning processes (cf.&nbsp;Swart et al.&nbsp;2004, Wiek and Iwaniec 2014). Target knowledge gives us the answer to the question of what we should transform. CDE’s study programmes are primarily guided by the following concepts of target knowledge for a sustainable economic and social system:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The principles of sustainable development</p></li>
<li><p>The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs (2015)</p></li>
<li><p>The WBGU’s Flagship Report “World in Transition: A Social Contract for Sustainability” (2011)</p></li>
<li><p>The Global Sustainable Development Report GSDR (2019)</p></li>
