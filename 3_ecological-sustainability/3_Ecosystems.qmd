## Ecosystems, Ecosystem management, and Ecosystem services

An ecosystem is a group of living organisms and their physical surroundings that interact with each other. Ecosystems can range from small, like a flowerpot, to large, like an ocean. When similar ecosystems are found in a larger region with the same climate, they are called biomes. Energy and material flows are important for the functioning of an ecosystem. Some of these flows, such as the carbon cycle, take place at the global level, while others are more localized. Most ecosystems obtain their energy from the sun and can influence the Earth’s climate through their interactions (Quelle: Britannica).

Ecosystem services are the benefits that humans derive from ecosystems such as mangrove forests, oceans, or wetlands. The services provided by ecosystems include the provision of clean water, the prevention of flooding, the promotion of crop growth, and the provision of places for leisure activities. The Millenium Ecosystem Assessment, published in 2005, divides ecosystem services into four categories (cf. green Box in @fig-ecosystem): *provisioning services*, *regulating services*, *cultural services*, and *supporting services* (Quelle:MEA, 2005). Note that the supporting services, which are primarily fundamental biophysical processes, enable and guarantee the other services in the first place.

According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, these ecosystem services can improve our quality of life and our economy (cf. blue Box in @fig-ecosystem). While this way of looking at ecosystems views humans as separate from the environment, it emphasizes the relevance of ecosystem services for human well-being. Ultimately, the concept of ecosystem services seeks to place greater consideration on the value of nature in policy and economic decisions. However, the ecosystem services concept also plays a role in landscape and spatial planning. For example, it’s used to analyse how spatially effective (legal) regulations impact ecosystem services, and consequently, human well-being (Quelle: cf. Albert et al. 2016).

**Case study: Ecosystem services in Madagascar**

This landscape on the eastern coast of Madagascar offers a case study for ecosystem services. Ecosystem services in this area include firewood, which is used by local inhabitants for cooking, and rice, which is a staple food. Describing agricultural products such as these as ecosystem services illustrates that they only become “services” through human demand. Ecosystem services are not given in nature per se: instead, they represent a perspective through which humans view and describe the environment. Other ecosystem services in this landscape include the water cycle, which is vital for local inhabitants, as they rely on rivers for drinking water. Water is also used for agricultural irrigation and other purposes. Climate regulation is another significant service, important both locally and globally.

This landscape clearly illustrates that the demand for and importance of ecosystem services vary among individuals or groups. Such diverse claims on ecosystem services from the same land can lead to **conflicts of interest**. Demand for agricultural products or firewood, for example, can conflict with climate-regulating and biodiversity-promoting (international) demands on the rainforest.

Humans have had an influence on many ecosystem services, both directly and indirectly. While these impacts have often been negative, some have been positive. For example, replacing natural ecosystems with cultivated agroecosystems has increased the value of ecosystem services for humans. Take, for example, dry meadows and pastures in Switzerland. Only through centuries of forest clearing and extensive agricultural use in alpine locations could the ecosystem services these areas provided (in this case, fodder production) be used and increased. At the same time, these anthropogenically influenced sites harboured rare meadow plants and pollinators, thus fostering a high level of biodiversity. These areas are also vital for tourism, as they significantly shape the alpine landscape. Consequently, these extensively used areas generally offer greater overall ecosystem service multifunctionality than intensively farmed grasslands (Quelle: Richter et al. 2024).

Many of the negative effects on ecosystems and their services result directly from human land use and overfishing. In addition, indirect factors such as climate change and invasive non-native species significantly impair the stability and functionality of ecosystems. Two research projects with significant CDE involvement – Woody Weeds and Woody Weeds+ – have demonstrated that invasive woody plants such as *Prosopis juliflora* have a major impact on biodiversity and local livelihoods in East Africa. Originally introduced to combat desertification and timber extraction, this species displaces native vegetation and is not suitable as animal feed without processing ([CDE](https://www.cde.unibe.ch/forschung/projekte/woody_invasive_alien_species_in_eastern_africa/index_ger.html)).

### The monetary valuation of ecosystem management

The term *nature’s services* first appeared in the publication “How much are Nature’s Services Worth?” (Quelle: Westman, 1977). The synonymous term “*ecosystem services*” was coined a few years later (Quelle: Ehrlich and Ehrlich, 1981). The concept of ecosystem services and the thinking behind it are closely linked to economic philosophy and practice (Quelle: Gómez-Baggethun et al. 2010). Around 20 years after the introduction of “nature’s services”, Robert Costanza and colleagues estimated that the **global value of 17 ecosystem services was worth 33 trillion US dollars per year** (Quelle: Costanza et al. 1997). A recalculation in 2011 showed that this value had already fallen by between 4.3 trillion and 20.2 trillion US dollars per year (Quelle: Costanza et al. 2014). It is predicted that by 2050, the value of ecosystem services will either drop by up to USD 51 trillion per year, or rise by up to USD 30 trillion per year, depending on land use scenario (Quelle: Kubiszewski et al. 2017).

Calculating the **monetary value of ecosystem services** typically involves three steps and requires high-quality and differentiated data. 1) The first step is to measure the change in ecosystem services after an intervention, thus placing the focus not on the status quo, but on the difference. 2) The second step is to evaluate the impact of this change on people’s socio-economic well-being. 3) The third and final step is to place a monetary value on the resulting change in productivity or prosperity (Quelle: *M1 Lecture by* *Astrid Zabel*). There are **many different methods for calculating the monetary value of ecosystem services** (@fig-monetary-value). One such method is “green accounting”, which uses existing market values, if available, or exchange values as an approximation (e.g. comparing avalanche barriers and protection forests). Another method is cost–benefit analysis, which can be divided into two types: stated preferences and revealed preferences.

![the monetary value of ecosystem services (Quelle?)](images/Images_en/Fig3_3__EcosystemValuation.jpg){#fig-monetary-value}

**Stated preferences** involves people stating (e.g. in a survey) the extent to which they would be willing to pay for certain ecosystem services, or which changes they would be willing to accept (contingent valuation). Another variation of this method involves choosing between different (usually sub-optimal) options, each representing a trade-off based on changes in ecosystem services (which are then analysed econometrically). In contrast, **revealed preferences** are based on actual behaviour. For example, it involves analysing avoidance costs (e.g. how much people pay for noise barriers) or calculating travel costs (which assumes that the time and travel costs incurred for visiting a destination reflect the value of the place, and thus, in a broader sense, an ecosystem service). Other methods include using hedonic approaches to determine the extent to which favourable or unfavourable environmental influences, and thus their quality, can affect the value of a property.

Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages. They are criticized mainly for their one-sided assessments and failure to account for social inequalities, power relations, and cultural differences. Consequently, these methods are limited in their ability to promote fair and environmentally sustainable decisions (see next chapter).

The principle behind **Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES)** involves compensating land users for maintaining a component of a specific ecosystem service. Such compensation may, for example, be paid by organizations or companies for which these specific ecosystem services are important. A well-known example of PES is the “Pagos por Servicios Ambientales” (PSA) programme in Costa Rica. This national programme, which has been operational since 1997, was set up to reduce deforestation and promote reforestation by paying landowners to maintain, reforest, or sustainably manage forest areas. The payments aim to promote the provision of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, water conservation, biodiversity conservation, and scenic beauty. The payments in this project come from various sources, including a tax on fuels and international funding from organizations interested in carbon offsetting. Studies show that the programme has significantly reduced the rate of deforestation in the country and promoted the conservation of biodiversity, while at the same time increasing the income of landowners (Quelle: Porras et al. 2013).

## Criticism of ecosystem services, and further and alternative concepts

While the concept of ecosystem services has been recognized and applied in the scientific and policy debate, it has also been widely criticized (Quellen: see e.g. Norgaard, 2010; Kosoy & Corbera, 2010). One argument is that by focusing on ecosystem services, we reduce the complex and diverse values of ecosystems to their monetary benefits for humans (Quelle: cf. Schröter et al. 2014). This **economic reduction of nature** neglects the non-quantifiable but nevertheless important aspects of nature, such as spiritual or intrinsic values (Quelle: Fairhead er al. 2012). The commodification of nature through ecosystem services could ultimately also lead to an exploitative relationship between humans and nature (cf. Schröter et al. 2014) or **an exacerbation of social inequalities between powerful actors and marginalized groups** (Quelle: Dawson et al. 2021), as the concept does not explicitly consider justice (Quelle: Loos et al. 2023: 478). In some cases, it is even assumed that the concept of ecosystem services could conflict with – and undermine – biodiversity conservation (cf. Schröter et al. 2014).

In response to this criticism, the IPBES (Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services), (see Biodiversity chapter) has further developed the concept of ecosystem services and developed another concept, that of *Nature’s Contribution to People* (NCP). NCPs are defined as “all the positive contributions, or benefits, *and* occasionally negative contributions, losses or detriments, that people obtain from nature.” (Quelle: Pascual et al. 2017: 9). The concept may resemble ecosystem services, but it goes further and recognizes that nature and its contributions to a good life can be perceived and viewed in different ways, depending on the cultural and institutional context. The concept seeks to include different world views, such as Indigenous knowledge systems, thus taking into account both intrinsic (i.e. non-anthropocentric) and relational values of nature (Quelle: Díaz et al. 2018). Overall, this approach also includes context-specific perspectives, and it gives greater consideration to the justice dimensions than the concept of ecosystem services does (Quelle: Loos et al. 2023).

However, such **plural valuations** are also subject to criticism and pose various challenges. For example, Jacobs et al. (2023) point out that current approaches to integrating multiple values and perspectives into ecosystem assessments risk merely promoting pseudo-participation, while existing **structures of power and discrimination** remain unchanged. Plural valuations aim for inclusivity and democracy, but they can inadvertently lead to conflict, power imbalances, and unclear outcomes if not carefully designed. Scientists have also criticized the above-mentioned NCP concept, which is often seen as an inadequate development of **utilitarian environmentalism**. This is a strongly Western and anthropocentric perspective that maintains a dualistic separation of humans and nature (Quelle: cf. Muradian & Gomez-Baggethun, 2021). Muradian & Gomez-Baggethun (2021: 7), propose that “in order to induce transformative change in human-nature relations we need a shift from a morality of utility to a morality of care, a reallocation of property rights, and the extension of the community of justice to non-human entities.” A notable example of this transformation is the 2017 recognition of New Zealand’s Whanganui River as a legal person (Quelle: see Charpleix, 2018).
