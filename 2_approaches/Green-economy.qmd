### Green economy

In a pioneering use of the term “green economy”, David Pearce and Edward Barbier launched their groundbreaking *Blueprint for a Green Economy* series in 1989. The series was the first to present economic frameworks and programmatic approaches for achieving the dual goals of economic prosperity and ecological well-being (Pearce et al. 1989, 1991, 1993; Pearce/Barbier 2000; Barbier/Markandya 2013). The green economy’s core principle challenges the traditional view that economic growth and environmental well-being are inherently at odds. It proposes a paradigm shift, moving away from bans and restrictions. Instead, it advocates for economic incentives and strategies that promote environmental sustainability while fostering positive models of economic and technological development aligned with both ecological and social goals.

In the run-up to Rio+20, the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, the green economy concept was finally developed into a guiding principle that shaped the debate (United Nations 2011a; 2011b; Bär et al. 2011; Creech et al. 2012). “Green economy” was one of two key themes of Rio +20; the other was the “institutional framework” for sustainable development. Accordingly, numerous documents on the green economy were published in 2011 and 2012, and a seminal definition of the term was published by the organizing agency of Rio+20, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in the report, *Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication* (UN 2011a, p. 31; UNEP 2011, p. 16). The OECD also contributed its own response to the financial crisis with its resolution on “Green Growth” (OECD 2009a).

“UNEP defines a green economy as one that results in improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. In its simplest expression, a green economy can be thought of as one which is low carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive. In a green economy, growth in income and employment should be driven by public and private investments that reduce carbon emissions and pollution, enhance energy and resource efficiency, and prevent the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.” (UNEP 2011, p. 2)

While Rio+20 cemented the concept of a green economy, the need for a fundamental global change in thinking was already widely accepted. It had become clear that while environmental protection measures cost money, they also have a positive economic impact by creating jobs (see e.g. UBA 2008) and sparking innovation in technological efficiency advancements (cf. e.g. Weizsäcker et al. 1995). The green economy concept systematizes such findings and calls for programmes to overcome the apparent contradictions between economy and ecology, growth and resource conservation, as well as prosperity and environmental protection. The concept thus marks a significant paradigm shift. Adhering to planetary boundaries or ecological guidelines in a green economy does not necessarily mean forgoing economic growth and technological progress (Rockström et al. 2009; Steffen et al. 2011; SRU 2011). Instead, the idea is that by harmonizing these apparently contradictory aims, we can achieve them even more efficiently. The EU Green Deal exemplifies this concept. The EU aims to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, aiming for a modern, resource-efficient, and competitive economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. This plan seeks to decouple growth from resource use while ensuring a just transition that leaves no one behind.

### Conclusion

The core thesis of the green economy is that environmental and economic goals are not contradictory. Instead, they can be reconciled through appropriate economic incentives and strategies. The green economy aims to foster both economic growth and environmental sustainability through public and private investment in low-emission, resource-efficient, and socially equitable economic systems.

Critics, however, have raised concerns about the effectiveness of green economy measures. They argue that the proposed technologies and incentives are insufficient to bring about the far-reaching systemic changes needed. An overemphasis on economic growth and technological solutions could potentially neglect essential structural and behavioural changes. And they warn that the global transition to a green economy could leave behind disadvantaged communities and developing countries, if their specific needs are not addressed.
