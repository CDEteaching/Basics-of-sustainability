## Post-growth societies
The post-growth debate emerged from concerns raised in the 1970s, after publication of the influential Meadows Report, The Limits to Growth (1972). As previously mentioned, this report highlighted the Earth’s finite capacity to sustain humanity in the face of unrestrained economic growth. The post-growth debate advocates qualitative growth or even zero growth, and criticizes the effects of the “modern” economy and lifestyles (e.g. Binswanger 1985). It argues that the compulsion for constant growth is making us exceed ecological limits and leading to negative social and ecological consequences. “Ecological economics” is an important concept in this respect, as it aims to develop alternative models and approaches for evaluating economic growth.

The dilemma in this debate is that most approaches to a sustainable economy assume that a growth-independent economy should not be profit-driven. However, capitalist economies are existentially dependent on growth (e.g. Binswanger 2019, Oberholzer 2021). This dilemma is key to the question of how to organize a successful transition from the current unsustainable system to a sustainable economic and social system. One main approach is to reduce dependencies on growth and promote alternative models that focus on sufficiency, without neglecting strategies that focus on efficiency and consistency. This requires changes in production and consumption patterns, in social norms, and in the political framework. The post-growth debate emphasizes the need for a comprehensive transformation that encompasses environmental, social, and economic dimensions – and aims to achieve a balance between human needs and planetary boundaries.

The concept of “sufficiency” is an integral part of the post-growth debate (Schneidewind & Zahrnt, 2013). Sufficiency aims to reduce overconsumption and promote alternative lifestyles, consumption habits, and production patterns. To promote widespread adoption of sufficiency, a legal and institutional framework that incentivizes and facilitates sufficiency-oriented practices is necessary.

A policy to promote sufficiency can actively shape our choices, through attractive sufficiency-oriented offers and services. It can also foster awareness and provide guidance for adopting sufficiency-oriented lifestyles and practices. This comprehensive approach aims to shift consumption towards what is necessary and meaningful, ultimately reducing excessive resource use.

### Criticism and conclusion

Post-growth debates analyse and criticize modern society’s dependency on economic growth, and the negative environmental and social effects of this growth. Rather than focus solely on technological progress and market forces, post-growth society theories strive for changes in society, structures, and institutional frameworks. Overall, post-growth debates emphasize the need for sustainable approaches to achieve a comprehensive transformation of the economy and society. Transformation to a post-growth society requires a reorientation of values, structures, and institutional frameworks. The challenge is to find ways to shape the transition to an economy independent of growth, while at the same time ensuring social justice and ecological sustainability.

Critics of post-growth debates argue that a rejection of economic growth could have a negative impact on prosperity and social progress. They fear that an economy independent of growth could lead to stagnating innovation, fewer jobs, and falling living standards. And they point out that a negative attitude towards economic growth can have potential negative effects. Constructively addressing the challenges of growth and developing viable alternatives are important aspects of enabling sustainable and equitable change.
